## Spec
> Our national health service has decided to create a portal that will allow citizens to report a positive antigen test for COVID-19 and to list their close contacts online. <br> Citizens who have symptoms of the virus or are a close contact of a confirmed case can use store-bought test kits and upload any positive results to the portal. <br> The system will require citizens to create an account with a username and password, to provide personal information including full name, address, date of birth and phone number, and to upload an image of a positive antigen test. They can also provide a list of close contacts, including their full names and phone numbers.
